# TrueVisage: Cutting-Edge Methods for Detecting Manipulated Faces

TrueVisage is a dataset developed for forensic analysis, containing 1000 videos manipulated using the latest techniques such as Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap, and NeuralTextures. This dataset is suitable for image and video classification tasks, with additional binary masks for segmentation. We also provide Deepfake models for data generation and augmentation.

New Features
FaceShifter: An advanced face-swapping method that preserves identity even with facial occlusions, applied to the entire dataset.
Deepfake Detection Dataset: A dataset with 3000 manipulated videos collected from various sources.
Neural Textures: A new method using GAN for facial manipulation, added to the dataset and benchmark.
Access
To download the dataset, please fill out this form and wait for the download link.

Benchmark
Use the automated benchmark to test facial manipulation detection with 1000 compressed images.

License
This dataset is released under the TrueVisage Terms of Use and the code is available under the MIT License.
